# Lightweight Social Media Style Blog (PHP)

This is a **simple**, **lightweight**, yet **powerful** social media-styled blog website built with PHP. It supports HTML formatting, so you can style your blog posts the way you like.

The project is ready to use out of the box, and more features are planned for future updates, including:

### Planned Features
- Post editor toolbar
- Archive page
- Contact page
- Like, comment, view counters, and share buttons
- Media upload from device
- Replace basic text area with [Summernote](https://summernote.org/) rich text editor

The goal is to keep the blog **lightweight**, **modern**, and **easy to use** without sacrificing functionality.
